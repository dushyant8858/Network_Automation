# Network Automation using Ansible

Bringing DevOps and Networking at one platform in this project. To eliminate the large time spent on creating scripts using python and then implementing them on devices, we will be using Ansible which leverages open-source material and supports multiprocessing to automate network device as quickly as possible. We will be automating the process of creating docker containers and installing various packages on target machines, establishing OSPF neighborship between two routers and creating VLANs on switches using ansible playbooks from a single host machine.
